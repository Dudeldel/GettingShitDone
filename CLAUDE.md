# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## What this is

"Getting Shit Done" (GSD) — a **single-user** GTD app. Two halves in one repo:

- **Backend** (repo root): Laravel REST API. Holds all domain logic.
- **Frontend** (`frontend/`): separate Vite + React (TypeScript) SPA that consumes the REST API.

Core domain: capture an idea → guided **clarify** (the GTD decision tree: actionable? → single-step? → < 2 min? → delegable?) → route it to **exactly one** of 8 buckets (inbox, next actions, projects, calendar/dates, delegation, someday/maybe, reference, trash). Product spec: @context/foundation/prd.md. Stack rationale: @context/foundation/tech-stack.md.

Architecture and conventions are adopted from a sibling production Laravel service ("the twin", WikroST), adapted to this app. Self-contained — do not assume the twin's wiki is reachable.

## CRITICAL — what NOT to copy from the twin (read before adding infra)

The twin is a multi-tenant sharded microservice. This app is the opposite shape. Do **not** transplant:

- **No multi-tenancy.** Multi-user/sharing is a **permanent** non-goal (@context/foundation/prd.md). Never add `BelongsToTenant` / `BelongsToCompany`, `PartConnectionManager`, Central-vs-Part DB sharding, `ResolveTenantAuth` / `ResolveCompany` middleware, or tenant/company isolation. One user, one database.
- **No tenant-scoped ability split.** The twin's `fixed-assets:read|write` per-tenant abilities and `ApiClient` model do not apply. Auth here is one account via Sanctum.
- **Deploy is self-host on AWS Lightsail + GitHub Actions** (@context/foundation/tech-stack.md) — NOT the twin's Helm/K8s + Bitbucket Pipelines. Keep the *gates* (below), change the *host*.

## Environment tripwires

- **Composer is not global** — invoke it as `php composer.phar` from repo root (the phar lives there, git-ignored). Plain `composer` will fail.
- **The REST API is not scaffolded yet.** Fresh scaffold has only `routes/web.php`. Run `php artisan install:api` to add `routes/api.php` + Sanctum before building endpoints (PRD requires a REST API with email+password auth).
- **Most adopted tooling is not installed yet** (Pest, Larastan, Scramble). The scaffold ships PHPUnit + Pint only. There is no `Makefile` (the twin uses `make` targets; use the commands below).

## Commands

Backend (repo root):

```bash
php composer.phar setup        # install deps, .env, key:generate, migrate, build (first run)
php composer.phar dev          # concurrent: artisan serve + queue:listen + pail (logs) + vite
php composer.phar test         # config:clear + php artisan test  (currently PHPUnit)
php artisan test --filter=Name # run a single test (method or class name)
php artisan test tests/Feature/FooTest.php   # run one file
./vendor/bin/pint              # format (auto-fix)
./vendor/bin/pint --test       # format check only (CI gate)
```

Frontend (`cd frontend`):

```bash
npm run dev      # vite dev server
npm run build    # tsc -b && vite build
npm run lint     # eslint
```

## Nested rule files — read the one for the area you touch

Detailed rules live next to the code they govern, so each loads near the top of its own context instead of being buried here:

- **@app/CLAUDE.md** — backend conventions (DTOs, services, validation, constants), the block map + "which block to use" decision tree, controller shape, CRUD-vs-async patterns, Larastan/Scramble annotations, and structured logging. **Read before writing anything under `app/`.**
- **@tests/CLAUDE.md** — test framework and conventions (Pest, Unit/Feature split).
- `frontend/` — React/Vite SPA with its own ESLint/TS config; no extra agent rules yet.

## Architecture — strict one-directional layering

The scaffold is vanilla Laravel today; **build into this structure** as features land.

```
Request → FormRequest → Controller → Service → [Entity / Strategy] → Repository(interface) → Repository(impl) → Model → DB
                                                       ▲
                                            DTO / VO / Payload carried between layers
                                                       ▼
                                                    Job (optional, on a queue)
```

Non-negotiable rules (what an agent gets wrong by default):

- Controller **NEVER** calls a Repository directly — always through a Service.
- Controller **NEVER** touches Eloquent (no `Model::find()` in a controller). It is ~3 lines: map HTTP ↔ Service, return JSON.
- Service does **NOT** import the HTTP framework (no `Request`, no `response()`), and calls repositories **through an interface**.
- Repository returns a **DTO**, never an Eloquent Model. A Model must never leak past `app/Infrastructure/`.
- Entity / Strategy / Value Object are **pure PHP** — no Eloquent, no DB, no framework.

How the GTD domain maps onto the layers:

- **The 8 buckets** → a backed enum (`enum GtdBucket: string`).
- **The clarify decision tree + routing + the 2-minute rule** are the core business rule (@context/foundation/prd.md "Business Logic") → an **Entity** (e.g. `InboxItemEntity`) or domain service, **never** a controller or model. Growing branch variants → a **Strategy** per branch + a Factory.
- **Eisenhower quadrant** = derived from `important × urgent` — a computed view, not stored state.
- **Delegation** = a free-text "who/what" note + a done flag (PRD FR-007). **Not** a user/contact entity.

The full block map, the decision tree, controller shape, the CRUD-vs-async reference patterns, and the day-one tripwires are in @app/CLAUDE.md.

## Commits

Conventional Commits — `<type>(TICKET): <description>`; branch `type/TICKET-description`. Types: `feat`, `fix`, `refactor`, `test`, `chore`, `docs`, `perf`, `ci`.

## CI gates

GitHub Actions (@context/foundation/tech-stack.md), auto-deploy on merge to main. Flow: install deps → run in **parallel** (all must pass before merge):

- `./vendor/bin/pint --test` (format check)
- Larastan **level 6**
- **Pest** (SQLite in-memory; `--parallel`)
- Frontend: `npm run build` (includes `tsc -b`) + `npm run lint`

Mirror this as a local pre-push check. Pre-commit checklist: tests pass · Pint clean · Larastan 0 errors · new features have feature + unit tests · `Response::HTTP_*` not integers · Scramble docs updated for new/changed endpoints.

## 10xDevs AI Toolkit — Module 1, Lesson 5

Pick a deployment platform and ship to production with the **infra chain**:

```
(/10x-init  →  /10x-shape  →  /10x-prd  →  /10x-tech-stack-selector  →  /10x-bootstrapper  →  /10x-agents-md  →  /10x-rule-review  →  /10x-lesson)  →  /10x-infra-research  →  Plan Mode deploy
```

The full Module 1 chain ships from Lessons 1–4 (re-included so you can fix any earlier contract mid-flight). `/10x-infra-research` is the lesson's main topic; the deploy step itself uses the host's built-in **Plan Mode** rather than a dedicated skill — the artifact (`context/deployment/deploy-plan.md`) is what carries forward.

### Task Router — Where to start

| Skill | Use it when |
| --- | --- |
| **Infrastructure (lesson focus)** | |
| `/10x-infra-research [path-to-tech-stack-or-prd]` | You have a `context/foundation/tech-stack.md` (and ideally a `prd.md`) and need to pick an MVP deployment platform. The skill loads the stack as a hard constraint, runs a 5-question developer interview (persistent connections, cost sensitivity, existing familiarity, global reach, co-location preference), spawns parallel subagent research across six candidate platforms, scores them Pass/Partial/Fail across the five agent-friendly criteria from `references/agent-friendly-criteria.md`, shortlists the top three, and runs a three-lens anti-bias cross-check on the leader (devil's advocate, pre-mortem, unknown unknowns) before writing `context/foundation/infrastructure.md`. Use AFTER `/10x-tech-stack-selector`, BEFORE `/10x-implement`. |
| **Deploy (host built-in, not a skill)** | |
| Plan Mode deploy | You have `infrastructure.md` + `tech-stack.md` and want a read-only plan reviewed before any mutation hits the platform. Activate the host's plan mode (Claude Code: `Shift+Tab` cycles default → auto-accept → plan; IDE: dedicated button) with the prompt "Wykonajmy pierwsze wdrożenie w oparciu o `@infrastructure.md`, zgodnie ze stackiem z `@tech-stack.md`". Read the plan, demand corrections, approve, then let the agent execute. The approved plan persists at `context/deployment/deploy-plan.md` so the next lesson's milestone planning can reference what's already deployed and which secrets are already wired. |
| **Re-run upstream if needed** | |
| `/10x-init` / `/10x-shape` / `/10x-prd` / `/10x-tech-stack-selector` / `/10x-bootstrapper` / `/10x-agents-md` / `/10x-rule-review` / `/10x-lesson` / `/10x-stack-assess` / `/10x-health-check` | Bundled so you can patch any earlier contract mid-flight. If the anti-bias cross-check forces a platform swap that pushes a stack-shaped decision (e.g. "this DB doesn't fit any platform we'd accept"), re-run `/10x-tech-stack-selector` to keep `tech-stack.md` and `infrastructure.md` aligned. |

### How the chain hands off

- `/10x-infra-research` reads `context/foundation/tech-stack.md` (language, framework, runtime, database) as **hard constraints** — platforms that can't run the stack are dropped before scoring. It also reads `context/foundation/prd.md` (scale, latency, uptime expectations) as **soft weights** when scoring. Both inputs are optional but strongly recommended; without them the skill proceeds but warns.
- The skill writes `context/foundation/infrastructure.md` as the third foundation contract: frontmatter (`project`, `researched_at`, `recommended_platform`, `runner_up`, `context_type`, `tech_stack`) plus a body covering recommendation, full platform comparison with scoring matrix, anti-bias findings, operational story (preview / secrets / rollback / approval / logs), and a risk register tying every entry back to the lens that surfaced it. On collision the skill prompts: overwrite, save as `infrastructure-v2.md`, or abort.
- Plan Mode reads `infrastructure.md` and `tech-stack.md` together. The agent emits a step-by-step plan covering automated steps it owns, manual setup gates (account creation, secret configuration), exact deploy commands (Pages vs Workers commands are NOT interchangeable on Cloudflare — the plan must specify), and verification steps. The plan is rejected/edited until it's right; only then does Plan Mode exit and execution begin. The approved plan lands at `context/deployment/deploy-plan.md` and is consumed downstream by milestone-planning skills as ground truth for "what's already deployed".

### What the lesson's skills capture (and what they do NOT)

- **`/10x-infra-research` captures**: platform shortlist scored against five agent-friendly criteria (CLI quality, managed/serverless degree, agent-readable docs, stable/scriptable deploy API, MCP or first-class agent integration), three anti-bias outputs on the leader (numbered weaknesses, 150–200-word failure narrative, 3–5 unknown-unknowns), an operational story with one concrete answer per axis (not categories), and a risk register where every row names its source lens (`Devil's advocate` / `Pre-mortem` / `Unknown unknowns` / `Research finding`). Status of every non-GA feature is captured inline (`beta` / `preview` / `region-limited` / `deprecated`) with the date the status was checked.
- **`/10x-infra-research` does NOT** build Docker images or write Dockerfiles, configure CI/CD pipelines, or plan beyond MVP scope (multi-region HA is explicitly out of scope). It does NOT decide for you — the user accepts, swaps to runner-up, or aborts after the cross-check, and that decision is recorded in the output.
- **Plan Mode** captures: an explicit human gate between "agent has a plan" and "agent mutates production". The artifact (`deploy-plan.md`) is the audit trail for "what was supposed to happen" when the live run goes sideways. Plan Mode does NOT replace `/10x-infra-research` (the platform decision must already be made — Plan Mode plans the deploy, it doesn't pick where to deploy).

### The five agent-friendly criteria (and why they're load-bearing)

The criteria that make `/10x-infra-research`'s scoring matrix are not generic "good platform" axes — they're the specific traits that determine whether an agent can operate this platform from a session without you holding its hand:

1. **CLI-first** — every routine operation has a documented command; the agent doesn't need to click in a panel.
2. **Managed / serverless** — fewer moving pieces means fewer ways the agent (or you) breaks something the platform was supposed to handle.
3. **Agent-readable docs** — markdown / `llms.txt` / GitHub-hosted docs the agent can fetch and parse, not JS-rendered marketing pages.
4. **Stable, scriptable deploy API** — predictable exit codes, structured output, no interactive prompts mid-deploy.
5. **MCP server or first-class agent integration** — bonus, not required. CLI alone is fine for MVP; MCP earns its keep when the agent makes dozens of structured queries against live state.

Hard filters apply before scoring (persistent-connection requirement drops Netlify/Vercel serverless-only; tech-stack runtime mismatch drops the platform entirely). Interview answers reweight criteria after — cost sensitivity penalizes expensive base tiers, familiarity breaks ties, global-reach preference favours edge-native platforms, co-location preference favours integrated databases.

### Anti-bias as a decision discipline (not theatre)

Every research conversation with an LLM has a built-in tilt toward whatever the user already signalled. `/10x-infra-research` runs three structured lenses against the leader BEFORE the file is written, not after:

- **Devil's advocate** — *find the weaknesses, hidden costs, and failure modes specific to deploying `<this stack>` on `<this platform>`*. Output is a numbered list of 3–5 specifics, not categories.
- **Pre-mortem** — *six months later, this decision turned out to be a complete disaster; walk through the assumptions and underestimated risks that led there*. Output is a 150–200-word narrative; narratives surface concrete failure shapes that abstract risk lists hide.
- **Unknown unknowns** — *what's true about this combination that the marketing page and docs don't make obvious?* Output is 3–5 non-obvious risks.

After the cross-check the user has three real options: **proceed with the leader and absorb the risks into the register**, **swap to runner-up** (and re-run the cross-check on the new leader), or **swap to third place**. The third option is rare; if it never happens across many runs, the cross-check has degraded into a ritual and should be rewritten.

Two additional techniques (no skill required, raw prompts) belong in the same toolbox: forcing the model to compare three alternatives in a markdown table (structure beats "the same answer in different words"), and role-rotation (the same decision through a frontend dev's, security person's, and cost owner's eyes — surface the cost each role pays and propose alternatives if any of them flinch).

### CLI vs MCP for live-infra operability

After deploy, the agent needs a way to talk to the running platform. Two paths, complementary not competing:

- **CLI** (`wrangler`, `flyctl`, `vercel`, `gh`) — explicit and auditable, output stays in the terminal, safer defaults for irreversible actions (e.g. `netlify deploy` is draft by default; `--prod` must be passed). Best for MVP: minimal setup, low context cost (no tool schemas pre-loaded), and the agent has to know the command (which is where a per-tool skill helps).
- **MCP** — a dedicated server exposing structured tools with schemas (`pages_deployments_list`, etc.). Each connected MCP server adds tool definitions to the context window, so cost compounds across servers. Earns its keep when the agent makes many discovery-style queries against live state (logs, deployment diffs) and structured JSON beats parsing CLI output.

Sensible default: start with CLI, add MCP when you notice a recurring pattern of `--help` traversal the agent has to do to answer a class of questions. Anthropic's own [building-agents-that-reach-production](https://claude.com/blog/building-agents-that-reach-production-systems-with-mcp) framing is "API, CLI, and MCP are three complementary paths" — pick by task, not by hype.

### Production-access boundary (minimal permissions, human-on-irreversibles)

Both CLI and MCP can give the agent direct access to production. The lesson sets a default posture:

- **Tokens are scoped, not master keys.** On Cloudflare: an API token limited to Pages or Workers for one project, no DNS, no Workers Secrets for unrelated projects, no billing. AWS / GCP equivalent: scoped IAM role with `console-only-user` or read-only on production, full access on staging.
- **Tokens live in env vars, not in `.mcp.json` committed to the repo.** The agent picks them up via the MCP server or CLI's env-discovery, not via plaintext in conversation.
- **Destructive actions are human-only.** Drop a database, rotate a primary secret, delete a project — those are panel-by-hand operations, even if the agent suggests them. Manual click costs 30 seconds; cleanup after an automated mistake costs hours.

This is the MVP posture. As the project matures, the natural evolution is staging gets full agent access, production becomes read-only — covered in later modules.

### Foundation paths used by this lesson

- `context/foundation/tech-stack.md` — input (Lesson 2 hand-off, hard constraints)
- `context/foundation/prd.md` — input (Lesson 1 hand-off, soft weights)
- `context/foundation/infrastructure.md` — output (the third foundation contract)
- `context/deployment/deploy-plan.md` — output of Plan Mode deploy (audit trail of "what was supposed to happen")
- `context/foundation/lessons.md` — recurring rules & pitfalls (use `/10x-lesson` from Lesson 4 if you spot a class of agent failure during research or deploy)
- `docs/reference/contract-surfaces.md` — load-bearing names registry

### Universal language

The shipped skill carries no 10xDevs / cohort / certification references. The candidate platform list (Cloudflare, Vercel, Netlify, Fly.io, Railway, Render) is the starting research lens, not a recommendation set — the scoring + interview + cross-check pipeline is what's load-bearing, and a platform absent from the default list can be added by extending the research step. The five agent-friendly criteria are the artifact's true core; `/10x-infra-research` re-reads them from `references/agent-friendly-criteria.md` so they evolve as platforms do.

Skills must not write to `context/archive/`. Archived changes are immutable; if a resolved target path starts with `context/archive/`, abort with: "This change is archived. Open a new change with `/10x-new` instead."
